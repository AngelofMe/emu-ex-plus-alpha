The following sections supplement the ones in the main INSTALL text for the Android port. A device running at least Android 2.3 is required to run Imagine.

1. Tools and Environment Setup
==============================

Download & install Android Studio 3.0. Define environment variables ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and/or ANDROID_HOME according to the Android Studio docs @ https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables.html 

If using MacOS X, install the gmake package from MacPorts and use it instead of the regular make command when building.

The following make variables are used by the build system:

ANDROID_NDK_PATH : Optional, no default
 - The Android NDK root path containing the "platforms", "toolchains", & "sources" subdirectories for use if different than the NDK bundled with Android Studio

android_arch : Optional, default set by app
 - When building an Imagine-based app, specifies a space separated list of which architectures to build ("arm64 armv7 x86" for example)

2. Dependencies
===============

Install the SDK platform for Android 8.0 (API 26), Android NDK Revision 16, and the Android Support Library from Android Studio's SDK tools menu

3. Building
===========

In addition to the native library, build & install the Java portion of Imagine (imagine-v9.jar) using:

make -f android-java.mk install

To sign the release APK with your key, set the following variables in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and fill in the appropriate values:

ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=myKey
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=myPassword
ANDROID_KEY_STORE=/home/user/myKey.keystore
ANDROID_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=myPassword
