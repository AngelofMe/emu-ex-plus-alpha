The following sections supplement the ones in the main INSTALL text for the Android port. A device running at least Android 2.3 is required to run Imagine.

1. Tools and Environment Setup
==============================

Download & install Android Studio 3.0

Download & extract Android NDK Revision 16 from https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk/wiki or install it via Android Studio. Perform any one of the following to tell the build system the location of the NDK directory:

1. Add the root NDK directory to your PATH environment
2. Link or rename the root NDK directory to $(HOME)/android-ndk
3. Define ANDROID_NDK_PATH as shown below to use a custom location.

If using MacOS X, install the gmake package from MacPorts and use it instead of the regular make command when building.

The following make variables are used by the build system:

ANDROID_NDK_PATH : Optional, defaults to $(HOME)/android-ndk
 - The Android NDK root path containing the "platforms", "toolchains", & "sources" subdirectories

android_arch : Optional, default set by app
 - When building an Imagine-based app, specifies a space separated list of which architectures to build ("arm64 armv7 x86" for example)

2. Dependencies
===============

Install the SDK platform for Android 7.0 (API 24) and the Android Support Library from Android Studio's SDK Manager

3. Building
===========

In addition to the native library, build & install the Java portion of Imagine (imagine-v9.jar) using:

make -f android-java.mk install

To sign the release APK with your key, set the following variables in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and fill in the appropriate values:

ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=myKey
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=myPassword
ANDROID_KEY_STORE=/home/user/myKey.keystore
ANDROID_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=myPassword
