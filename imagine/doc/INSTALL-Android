The following sections supplement the ones in the main INSTALL text for the Android port. A device running at least Android 2.3 is required to run Imagine.

1. Tools and Environment Setup
==============================

Download & install Android Studio (stable channel). Define environment variables ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and/or ANDROID_HOME according to the Android Studio docs @ https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables.html 

If using MacOS X, install the gmake package from MacPorts and use it instead of the regular make command when building.

The following make variables are used by the build system:

ANDROID_NDK_PATH : Optional, defaults to the highest version NDK found in ANDROID_SDK_ROOT
 - The Android NDK root path containing the "toolchains" & "sources" subdirectories for use if different than the NDK installed in ANDROID_SDK_ROOT

android_arch : Optional, default set by app
 - When building an Imagine-based app, specifies a space separated list of which architectures to build ("arm64 armv7 x86" for example)

2. Dependencies
===============

If needed, install Clang 16+ from android.googlesource.com via the script bundle/android/toolchains/get-clang-r487747.sh. Note that NDK r25 only has Clang 14 so this is required until a newer NDK releases.

Install the SDK platform for Android 11.0 (API 30), Android NDK Revision 25 (tested on 25.0.8775105), and the Android Support Library from Android Studio's SDK tools menu

3. Building
===========

To sign the release APK with your key, set the following variables in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and fill in the appropriate values:

ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=myKey
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=myPassword
ANDROID_KEY_STORE=/home/user/myKey.keystore
ANDROID_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=myPassword

When upgrading build tools like the NDK run the android-clean-project make target for each app to make sure project files (build.gradle, etc.) are re-created.
