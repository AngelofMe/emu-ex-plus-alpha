The following sections supplement the ones in the main INSTALL text for the Android port. A device running at least Android 2.3 is required to run Imagine.

1. Tools and Environment Setup
==============================

Install the Android NDK Revision 10, and add the bin paths of the GCC 4.9 toolchains (ARM and X86 architectures) to your PATH environment variable.

The following make variables are used by the build system:

ANDROID_NDK_PATH : Required, no default
 - The path of the root Android SDK directory containing the "platforms/" subdirectory

android_arch : Optional, default set by app
 - When building an Imagine-based app, specifies a space separated list of which architectures to build ("arm armv7 x86" for example)
